# Matrix-Fisher-Distribution

The matrix Fisher distribution is a compact form of an exponential density model developed for random matrices [1]. This repository contains Matlab files to evaluate probabilistic properties and tp perform stochastic analyses for the matrix Fisher distribution on the special orthogonal group SO(3), formulated in the following paper

T. Lee, "Bayesian Attitude Estimation with the Matrix Fisher Distribution on SO(3)(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03746)," 	arXiv:1710.03746, 2017
